Azure Blob Repo
======

This example leverages the code from https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/ipfs-101,
but uses an instantiated Azure blob service container instance to serve as the entire backend for ipfs.

## Running
Update the env file with Azure Storage Connection String:

Once the Blob Service instance has its needed data, you can run the example:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
